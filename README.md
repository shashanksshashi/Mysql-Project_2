# Mysql-Project_2
The project aim was to analyze the North-wind dataset to gain insights such as average unit price ordered by each customer, the previous order dates for a particular quantity, cumulative moving average of unit price for a particular product.
This was achieved by querying the database in MySQL and used CTE and windows functions to optimise the queries.
